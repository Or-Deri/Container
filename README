README for MyContainer Assignment
This project makes a simple container class called MyContainer that 
holds items you can compare.
You can add items, remove items, and check how many items are inside.

You can also go through the items in different ways :

Order: the order you added items.

AscendingOrder: from smallest to largest.

DescendingOrder: from largest to smallest.

SideCrossOrder: smallest, largest, then 2nd smallest, 2nd largest, and
so on.

ReverseOrder: the reverse of the add order.

MiddleOutOrder: start from the middle item, then alternate left, right
left.

All code is in the container namespace.



Project files:

MyContainer.hpp: code for the container and iterators

main.cpp: example showing how to use the container

test.cpp: unit tests using the doctest framework

Makefile: commands to build, test, check memory, and clean


Makefile automates build and test:

    make Main – builds the demo 
    ./main - runs the demo 

    make test – builds the unit tests
    ./test - runs the unit tests

    make valgrind_test – checks for memory leaks on test

    make valgrind_main – checks for memory leaks on main

    make clean – removes compiled files
